title: Limits & trade-offs
order: 8

There is no perfect cleaning.

Key trade-offs we accept explicitly:

- strict validation may drop more rows (but increases trust)
- flexible parsing improves coverage (but can hide edge cases)
- business rules require context (not everything can be inferred)

The goal is not maximum retention.
The goal is **maximum decision quality**.
