Build a **reproducible** and **auditable** process that turns messy exports into:

- a cleaned dataset
- a set of KPIs
- quality checks you can trust
- a report that explains what happened

Key requirements:

- explicit rules (no “magic” transformations)
- deterministic output (same input → same results)
- separated deliverables to reduce downstream errors
