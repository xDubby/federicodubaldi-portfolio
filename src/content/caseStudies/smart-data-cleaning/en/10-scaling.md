title: Future extensions
order: 10
---

Possible evolutions:

- support multiple input schemas
- dynamic rule configuration (per client / per tenant)
- validations driven by business profiles
- monitoring and alerting (quality drift over time)
- extension toward forecasting or decision simulation

The project is designed as a **solid base**,
not a closed solution.
